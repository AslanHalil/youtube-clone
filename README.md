This is a toy fullstack development app in which I learned about
deploying a video processing service on cloud run, which works similar to
an AWS EC2 instance.
Learned about creating and using google cloud run functions which are similar
to AWS lamba functions and also calling the same function within the app.
Creating the front-end which interacts with the cloud run functions in order
to receive videos, adding google authentication so that only users are 
allowed to upload videos.
